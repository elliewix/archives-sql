# 00-Setup

We'll be using the Firefox [SQLite manager plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/) that should be installed on the lab computers or you can install it on your own computer.

Once the plugin is installed and Firefox is restarted, you can go up to Tools and select SQLite Manager to open up the wizard.
