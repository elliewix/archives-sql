# DHoxSS17: Humanities Data: SQL

This is the SQL lesson for our workshop at DHoxSS17.  I am remixing the content from the standard Software Carpentry [SQL lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/license/) which was originally released under CCBY.  

I'm doing this under a generic markdown file for simplicity.

I am also releasing these materials CCBY.
