# Humanities/Archives SQL

What do you do when all your data is text?  

This lesson is introductory SQL using a finding aid as an example. You can learn a lot about a collection, particularly large ones, when the data is available as a table (or speadsheet). We'll be using a finding aid and looking at a collection of letters in SQL.

# Installation

This tutorial will reference SQLite Studio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt) for the software. However, the CSV data and DB are also available, so you can use cloud or other SQLite programs to follow along.  All lessons after the setup item are almost entirely platform agnostic.

# Attribution

Zenodo link for this lesson: TBD.

The data used here was remixed by Andrea Thomer (UMich iSchool as part of previous DHOxSS work and data cleaning instruction.

# History

This began as the the SQL lesson for our workshop at DHoxSS17 (https://github.com/elliewix/dhoxss17-sql).  That was originally remixed from the content from the standard Software Carpentry [SQL lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/license/) which was originally released under CCBY.  Much shorter and using a different dataset.

Feel free to submit a PR or an issue (issues are easier to file than PRs if you are newer to github, and I totally don't mind handling them if you're reporting a small typo etc.).
