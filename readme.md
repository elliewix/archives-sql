# DHoxSS17: Humanities Data: SQL

This is the SQL lesson for our workshop at DHoxSS17.  I am remixing the content from the standard Software Carpentry [SQL lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/license/) which was originally released under CCBY.  

I'm doing this under a generic markdown file for simplicity.  My first pass goal of this is to craft example SQL statements to work with the pettigrew data for this workshop.  I'll try to provide some prose, but this content (as it currently stands) is not meant to replace either of the Software or Data Carpentry materials.

I am also releasing these materials CCBY.
